Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository for the submission of the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Project Summary

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses.
